Expected validation performance~\cite{dodge2019show} as a function of hyperparameter assignments when \textit{ignoring fairness} for model selection (corresponds to an $\alpha=1.0$ trade-off). Its purpose is solely to validate the use of FairGBM in all cases, as the expected fairness improvement is large while performance drop is statistically insignificant (on AOF) or very minute ($-0.002$ on Adult). Future research work is needed on comparing the influence of hyperparameter search on multi-objective model comparison, as this plot is not adequate to compare both performance and fairness simultaneously. In contrast, the plots whose file-names contain "FAIRNESS-geq-0.8" correspond to the same metric but restricting model selection to models with fairness above 80\%, which is argualy a more adequate comparison.
